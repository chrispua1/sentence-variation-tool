# Sentence Variation Tool

## Under Development
[Click here](https://chrispua1.github.io/sentence-variation-tool/) to access the (incomplete) sentence variation tool.

## Introduction
Inspired by an assignment in ELA class, this tool can help you make sure your writing has enough variation between sentences, making it more interesting to read.

## Features
The sentence variation tool has many features that can help you with your writing. These include:
* A graph to show how varied your sentences are
* A list of your sentences, with similar beginnings highlighted
* More features to come!? (I have to finish the original thing first...)

## How To Use The Sentence Variation Tool
The sentence variation can be found at [chrispua1.github.io/sentence-variation-tool](https://chrispua1.github.io/sentence-variation-tool/). Copy and paste your writing into the text box, and click the submit button. You will then be presented with a graph and a list of your sentences.

## Open Source
Feel free to use this code in any way you want!
